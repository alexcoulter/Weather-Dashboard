## User Story

* This project is a weather dashboard to check current and future weather forecasts for anywhere in the world.
* When you load the site for the first time your browser will ask for permission to get your location.  If you say *'Yes'*, then the site will display your current location's weather.  If you say *'No'*, then nothing will automatically load.
* If you have used the site before, then your last searched city's weather will automatically load.
* You are then given the option to search for the weather of any city.  If that city is recognized by the **Openweathermap API**, then that city's current weather and future 5-day forecast will be displayed.  If not, then you will see an error pop-up asking you to try again.
* For every city that generates weather information, a new link with that city's name is displayed below the search box.  You can click on any of these links to check the weather of any city you have previously searched.
* This cities list is saved in local storage, so it will appear again if you come back to this site later.
* Once this list has 4 or more cities on it a *'Remove all Cities'* button pops up allowing you to erase the cities list if it gets too big.
